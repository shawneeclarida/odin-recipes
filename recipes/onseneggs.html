       <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
       <p>"Onsen" means hot spring in Japanese, and that's
           exactly how we make an Onsen Egg, we put it in a little
           hot spring. Cooking eggs this way makes the whites soft and
           silky, and the yolks become custard like. They are absolutely
           delicious. Grab some eggs and let's get cracking!</p>
       <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
       <p><ul><li>1-2 eggs</li><li>Water</li></ul></p>
       <h2><em>Directions</em></h2>
       <p><ol><li> Boil 4 cups of water.</li><li>Once the water is boiling,
           remove from heat and add 200 ml of cool water.</li><li>Immediately
           add your eggs to the water and cover. This works best with eggs
           that are room temperature.</li><li>Let your eggs sit in their Onsen
           for 17 minutes.</li><li>After 17 minutes remove your eggs and set to
           the side to rest.</li><li>After letting your eggs rest, they're ready
           to eat! Crack them into a bowl and enjoy. Traditionally Onsen Eggs are
           served with a mixture of dashi, mirin, and soy sauce. I personally like
           to have my Onsen Eggs with sesame oil and soy sauce, but they are
           delicious all on their own.</li><li>Enjoy!</li></ol></p>
