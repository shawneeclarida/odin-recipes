       <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
           <p> There's a million different ways to prepare a cucumber salad. This preparation
               is based on a German recipe. It's creamy, dreamy, and <em><strong>super</strong></em> addicting!
               It's filled with a butt load of dill and is extremely refreshing and light. So grab
               some cucumbers and let's get into it!</p>
       <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
           <P><ul><li>2 Large Cucumbers (I prefer English, but any cucumber will do)</li>
               <li>Sour Cream</li><li>White or Apple Cider Vinegar</li><li>Fresh or Dried Dill</li>
               <li>Salt</li><Suger</li></ul></p>
       <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
           <p><ol><li>Wash and peel 2 cucumbers.</li><li> Grate both cucumbers into a large bowl, and stir
               in 2 tablespoons of salt. Let this sit for at least 5 minutes. The salt will draw the
               water out of the cucumbers.<li>Drain the salty water from the cucumbers</li>
               <li>Add in two heaping (and I mean <em><strong>heaping</strong><em>) spoonfuls of sour cream.</li>
               <li> Add in 3 tablespoons of vinegar and one tablespoon of sugar.</li><li> Add as much dill
               as your heart desires. I usually add quite a bit. Keep in mind that if you are using fresh dill,
               the flavor is a lot stronger than dried dill.</li><li> Mix everything well and then add salt to
               taste.</li><li>Let your cucumber salad chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to let all
               the flavors to combine.</li><li>Enjoy!</li></ol></p>
